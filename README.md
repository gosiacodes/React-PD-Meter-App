# :sparkles: React PD Meter App :sparkles:

React PD-Meter App (measures distance between pupils) with MediaPipe Face Mesh - internship project (2023)

https://gosiacodes.github.io/React-PD-Meter-App/

## :pushpin: _How does the application work?_

Application uses your device camera.

In this project I used Googles AI solution MediaPipe Face Mesh that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time. 

It uses machine learning (ML) to infer the 3D surface geometry, requiring only a single camera input.

AI finds your pupils and measures distance between them. 

It is not that correct when you take multiple shots, but it is fun anyway. 

### _Instruction:_

Best results can be achieved when the face is about 40 cm from the camera.

Make sure there is good light and the camera is clean.

Sit still and do not move your head.

Look straight into the camera or at the red dot at the top and take a picture.

The result on the left is the approximate distance between pupils.

The result on the right is the PD average if you take multiple shots.

You can retake the picture as many times as you like (wait for the video to reload).

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
